    <h1><b>Ways of Seeing: Thoughts</b></h1>
    <h3><i>"The sight of it makes us want to possess it."</i></h3>
    <p>
      This line coupled with the background footage of something<br>
      like a bazaar or market made me think about the social aspect<br>
      of buying goods and showing one's posessions off. I think it <br>
      reminds us of the fact that the socially normative behavior is <br>
      to be spending, and that's why it has become OK to celebrate it.

      Do you feel the same?
